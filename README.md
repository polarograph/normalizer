# Normal1.8zer

![icon.png](src/main/resources/assets/normalizer/icon.png)

## Based on NoChangeTheGame by Cecer, but minified & up to date
Reverts some game mechanics back to their 1.8 style.

Hypixel has recently added sword blocking on vanilla 1.21.4+, removing the need for a lot of changes in NoChangeTheGame.

To reflect on that change, I've created this mod which uses much of the same code as NoChangeTheGame, but with a heavy reliance on Animatium (https://modrinth.com/mod/animatium) for the rest of the features.

Big thanks to Cecer for making the original mod, & big thanks to the Animatium team for their work. This mod should work on any server which added 1.21.4 sword blocking, but this mod is primarily made for use on Hypixel

## What does this mod modify?
This mod modifies:
- Swimming (disabled)
- Crawling (disabled)
- Sneak Hitbox (reverted back to 1.8)
- Waterlogging (disabled)

The following changes make the general experience much better & less buggy, allowing for smoother gameplay on the latest versions
